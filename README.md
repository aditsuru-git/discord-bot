# Check progress

To see what features or commands are ready in the bot, you need to look inside the **commands folder**.

- Each command is represented by a file inside this folder.
- The files are named in this format: `commandname.js`.

For example, if you see a file called `purge.js`, this means the bot has a "purge" command ready.

Note that these files are themselves inside subfolders.
